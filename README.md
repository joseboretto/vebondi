### Background

By the year 2017, I bought my first iPhone and at that moment there was any app for iOS to check real time bus arrivals in my city. I decided to use an existing web page from the government and create an app that consume the data form this site (http://cordoba.cuandollega.net/).

1.  Mockup.
2. Code
3. Deploy at https://zeit.co/
4. Marketing Course at https://platzi.com 
5. Marketing Campaign with Facebook Pixel

After a month, someone from the local government contact me and said me that I can't consume the data from their site and changed the credentials, that is why the app is not working anymore.
